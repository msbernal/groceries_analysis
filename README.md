# Grocerie Shopping pattern analysis

## Project Overview

In this project I worked with the Groceries Database to find patterns in the groceries consumption over the 2 years of data provided. The data provided is a relatively simple and clean dataset with which we can explore different time series techniques. 


### What you will find

1. EDA and data pre-processing using Python.
2. Stationarity and Tendencies analysis using Time Series Analysis with Python.
3. Market Basket Analysis using Apriori Algorithm in R.
